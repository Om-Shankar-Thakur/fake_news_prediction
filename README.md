Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop a fake news prediction system using machine learning. The system is designed to classify news articles as either "Real" or "Fake" based on the text content and other features.

Features
Input a news article and get a prediction on whether it's real or fake.
Explanation of the prediction, highlighting key features that influenced the model's decision.
Web-based interface for ease of use.
Demo
(Optional) Provide a link to a live demo or video showcasing the fake news prediction system in action.

Installation
Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project locally. Include any dependencies or requirements necessary for the system to function correctly.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/fake_news_prediction.git
cd fake_news_prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Explain how to use the fake news prediction system. Provide examples of input formats and expected output. If you have a web-based interface, describe how to access and interact with it.

css
Copy code
python predict.py --input "This is a sample news article to test the system."
Model and Data
Explain the machine learning model used for fake news prediction. If you used a pre-trained model, provide details about the model's source and its performance metrics. Mention the dataset used for training the model and provide a link if possible.
